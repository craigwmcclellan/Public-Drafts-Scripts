# Add to Things

This directory is for using Drafts 5's Javascript engine to add items to the task manager Things using it's URL scheme (available in version 3.4 and above).

The first script, addtoadmin.js, is a basic example of how to add a list in Drafts to a specific (predefined) project in Things, and choose what headings to add it under.

To get the project ID, in Things open the project you wish to use, select share, then copy URL. You will need to delete the rest of the URL and leave the ID.
