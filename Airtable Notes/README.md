# Airtable Notes Script

I am a teacher, and use Airtable to store data on my students. I am working on creating a script for Drafts where when I finish typing a note, Drafts will get a list of all student records and lesson records, prompt me to select a student and lesson, then create a new note associated with that student or lesson.

This script works with an Airtable base laid out like [this one](https://airtable.com/shrajtWn7mwVUb0wL). You can make a copy of that base with your own student data in it.

Once you copy this script into Drafts 5, you will need to login to [Airtable's API page](http://airtable.com/api), and get your unique Authorization token, and the ID from the base you would like to add data to. Put these into the script in the quotation marks as notated in the script.
