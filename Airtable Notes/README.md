# Airtable Notes Script

I am a teacher, and use Airtable to store data on my students. I am working on creating a script for Drafts where when I finish typing a note, Drafts will get a list of all student records and lesson records, prompt me to select a student and lesson, then create a new note associated with that student or lesson.

There is a small bug somewhere in this script, likely between lines 46 and 72 that is preventing the script from running.
